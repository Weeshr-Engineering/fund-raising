      "African events, celebration and gifting culture is a huge opportunity, reecently, we have seen a surge in online gift registry usage in Africa but the problem is, the solutions people use are from outsid Africa with a typical example being Amazon gift registry which is not tailored to the African market in terms of experience, currency and features. You are investing in Africa's primary gift registry that's growing rapidly. We found a loop in the market. One that is worth over $200B across Africa. We built a tailored solution that's seeing fastt adoption and we need you to get it off the ground to a point we raise our seed round.",
